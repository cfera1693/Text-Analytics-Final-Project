# Text-Analytics-Final-Project

Our project's main objective is to construct an article classifier which provides information about articles with promotional tone. An article can be classified as promotional or "good"/non-promotional. This classifier can be useful for businesses, which want to provide useful informative articles, and personal users, which are seeking for reliable information.
